## Assignment Logistics:
All projects will be submitted via gradescope. Each project will define their own format.
We will import your information into Gradescope which will create an account for you.
You are required to use this Gradescope account with the name and GTid that matches exactly with Canvas.

After that, you will receive a 0. ***The ONLY exception is a valid extension***.

## Extensions:
Extension requests must be made before the project deadline.
Requests are made via private Ed Discussion posts to all Instructors with proper documentation. (i.e. medical note from doctor or proof of deployment in the military.)
