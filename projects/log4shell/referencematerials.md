* [Project Introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmnUOYkI6A4) (Might not match the project requirements exactly)
* This simple  [LDAP server](https://github.com/mbechler/marshalsec)  that will be used to run the exploit.
* This [Log4JExploit Intro](https://www.lunasec.io/docs/blog/log4j-zero-day/) and [How Log4Shell Works](https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2021/12/17/inside-the-code-how-the-log4shell-exploit-works/) to familiarize yourself with the exploit and how it is accomplished.
* If you have no experience in Java, Log4j/logging, RESTful applications, JNDI, LDAP, we STRONGLY encourage you to do research into the topics. There are many great resources online like Google and YouTube. 
* [Log4J Documentation](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/)
* [Hands on Introduction to Log4Shell exploit in general (not this project but helpful)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJeAgQQaDEw)
* [Helpful Linux Networking Commands](https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2010/10/basic-networking-commands-in-linuxunix.html)
* [NCAT Command](https://www.linuxtechi.com/nc-ncat-command-examples-linux-systems/)
* [Log4Shell Example](https://securityblue.team/log4j-hunting-and-indicators/)
* If you would like to learn more about this exploit and Java Object Deserialization Vulnerabilities this paper written by Moritz Bechler is an excellent research paper: [Java Unmarshaller Security](https://github.com/mbechler/marshalsec/blob/master/marshalsec.pdf) and so is this BlackHat presentation: [A JOURNEY FROM JNDI/LDAP MANIPULATION TO REMOTE CODE EXECUTION DREAM LAND](https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-16/materials/us-16-Munoz-A-Journey-From-JNDI-LDAP-Manipulation-To-RCE.pdf)
