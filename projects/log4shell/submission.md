This project needs to be submitted via gradescope. Navigate to the course in Canvas, click ‘Gradescope’, click ‘Project Log4Shell’ and submit there. 

The contents of the submission file should be the following. There is a ~/project_log4shell.json file in your vm with a template set up, or you can copy-paste this to your newly created <span style="font-weight: bold;">project_log4shell.json</span> file elsewhere and replace the placeholders with the flags you retrieve from each relevant task.

*Note: You can use TextEdit or Vim to create and edit this file. Do not use LibreOffice or any Word Document editor. It must be in proper JSON format with no special characters in order to pass the autograder and these Word Document editors are likely to introduce special characters.*

If you can’t find the file in the VM just copy this format below:
```json
{
	"flag1": "<copy flag 1 here>",
	"flag2": "<copy flag 2 here>",
	"flag3": "<copy flag 3 here>",
	"flag4": "<copy flag 4 here>",
	"flag5": "<copy flag 5 here>",
        "flag6": "<copy flag 6 here>"
}
```

An example of what the submitted file content should look like:
```json
{
 "flag1": "4ec60c3e084d8387f0f33916e9b08b99d5264a486c29130dd4a5a530b958c5c0f1faeaca2ce30b478281ec546a4729f629b531a86cb27d86c089f0c542",
 "flag2": "f496d9514c01e8019cd2bc21edfeb8e33f4a29af14a8bf92f7b3c14b5e06c5c0f1faeaca2ce30b478281ec546a4729f629b531a86cb27d86c089f0c442",
 "flag3": "b621bba0bb535f2f7a222bd32994d3875bcfcad651160c543de0a01dbe2e0c5c0f1faeaca2ce30b478281ec546a4729f629b531a86cb27d86cf0c49542",
